  <p>Reading is like traveling without moving your feet. It takes you through distant lands, different eras, and inside the minds of fascinating characters. Every book holds the power to change a perspective or spark an idea.</p>

  <p>Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, poetry or philosophy, literature helps us understand the world and ourselves a little better. It's one of the most powerful tools humanity has ever created.</p>
